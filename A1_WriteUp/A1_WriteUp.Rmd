# Introduction

This study aims to investigate how literacy and the age at marriage affect family size in Portugal using data from the 1979 fertility survey. Prior research has shown that literacy and socio-economic factors play a significant role in determining fertility rates. [Cite relevant literature here]. 

# Methods

We use a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution to model the number of children per family, accounting for potential overdispersion using a quasi-Poisson or negative binomial approach.
